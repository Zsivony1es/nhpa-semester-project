# Randomized Matrix Multiplication

---

**Semester project for the course: Numerical High Performance Algorithms**

### Structure
Under the `src` directory, you can find different `.py` files, each containing a class.

### Executing code
All experiments were executed in the `experiments.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. To reproduce the plots 
from the report, simply execute all cells in order. In the last cell, the algorithm will be changed from BMM 
to EMM, thus re-executing cells 4 and 5 will yield results and plots for the new algorithm.
